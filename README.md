# AD - SBA - Core Java/JPA/JUnit 

* **Objective** 
    * To create a basic School Management System where students can register to courses, and view the course assigned to them.
* **Purpose**
    * To demonstrate understanding of the integration of SQL and JDBC
* **Description**
    * Only students with the right credentials can log in. Otherwise, a message is displayed stating: `“Wrong Credentials”`.
        1. Valid students are able to see the courses they are registered.
        2. Valid students are able to register to any course in the system as long as they are NOT already registered.

## Instructions

### Part 1 - Creating Tables
* Use your RDBMS to store the following tables.
* The tables should contain the columns from the specifications below.
* You can generate the required tables (without data populated) from your entities by using JPA.
* Place each of the `CREATE` statements in their respective `*.sql` file locations.
    * Each `*.sql` file can be found in the [resources directory](./src/main/resources) of this project.



#### Table 1 – Student
* Column1
    * Column Name: `email`
    * Column Data-Type: `varchar(50) not null (PK)`
    * Column Description: Student's current school email, unique student identifier
* Column2
    * Column Name: `name`
    * Column Data-Type: `varchar(50) not null`
    * Column Description: The full name of the student
* Column3
    * Column Name: `password`
    * Column Data-Type: `varchar(50) not null`
    * Column Description: Student's password used to log in


* **NOTE**: Place the `CREATE` statement in the respective [sql file location](src/main/resources/testing.person_create-table.sql).
    
    
#### Table 2 – Course
* Column1
    * Column Name: `id`
    * Column Data-Type: `int not null (PK)`
    * Column Description: Unique course identifier
* Column2
    * Column Name: `name` 
    * Column Data-Type: `varchar(50) not null`
    * Column Description: provides the name of the course
* Column3
    * Column Name: `instructor` 
    * Column Data-Type: `varchar(50) not null`
    * Column Description: provides the name of the instructor

* **NOTE**: Place the `CREATE` statement in the respective [sql file location](./src/main/resources/courses.create-table.sql).


### Part 1B - Populating tables
* insert test/dummy rows in Table 1 and Table 2 using SQL statements.
* Necessary SQL statements for populating the table can be in the [resources directory](./src/main/resources) of this project.
    * [courses.populate-table.sql](./src/main/resources/courses.populate-table.sql)
    * [students.populate-table.sql](src/main/resources/testing.person_populate-table.sql)
    
    


### Part 2 - Create Model Classes
* Using each of the interfaces provided in the `model` package as a guide, create a model for each of the aforementioned tables.
* Use the appropriate annotation to indicate
    * the models are to be used as an `Entity`
    * the name of the table each entity is based on
    * the variable that is used as a primary key
    * the relationships
    * the name of the column each variable is based on each entity.
* Every Model class must contain the following general two requirements:
    * A nullary constructor
    * A non-nullary constructor which initializes every private member with a parameter provided to the constructor.
    * entirely private fields
    * public getters and setters



### Part 3 - Familiarize with DAO Classes
* No code to be written for Part 3.
* Familiarize with each of the interfaces provided in the `dao` package.
* Read comments of interface to foreshadow their intention.


### Part 4 - Create Service Classes
* Using each of the interfaces provided in and `dao` packages as a guide, create a service for each of the aforementioned interfaces.


### Part 5 - Create SchoolManagementSystem Class
* Upon launching the application, users should land on the the `School Management System Dashboard`.
* From the `School Mangement System Dashboard`, users can
    1. access the `Student Dashboard` via `login`.
    2. quit the application via `logout`.
* From the `Student Dashboard`, users can
    1. view all courses in Database
    2. access the `Course Registry Dashboard`
    3. quit the application via `logout`
* From the `Course Registry Dashboard` users can
    1. register for a course
    2. quit the application via `logout`.

#### Dashboard Details
1. `School Management System Dashboard`
    * `login`
        * allows the user to enter his/her email and password and check whether or not those credentials are valid, in order to log in.        
        * If the credentials are invalid the program should end with an appropriate message to the student.
        * If login is successful, then Student is prompted from `Student Dashboard`
    * `logout`
        * terminates the application

2. `Student Dashboard`
    * `courses`
        * all the classes the Student is registered to should be displayed.
    * `register`
        * If the Student is already registered in that course, display the message "You are already registered in that course!", otherwise, register the student to that course and save this result to database.
        * upon registering successfully, display the updated registered courses list for that student.
    * `logout`
        * terminates the application

3. `Course Registration Dashboard`
    * `${some_integer_value}`
        * registers the student to the course whose `id` is the specified integer value
    * `logout`
        * terminates the application
